# odin-recipes

This is my first <em>Odin Project</em> web task of a cooking recipe page.

If you happen to stumble upon this repository, and have any constructive criticisms, please feel free to comment/message my files as I am currently learning

I aim to improve my CSS and HTML design in order to make the website more aesthetically pleasing. Features such as:
<ul>
	<li>smaller recipe cards, more consise that look better</li>
	<li>Implementation of CSS Grid layouts</li>
	<li>Headers and footers</li>
</ul>

These features may come soon as I go through the <em>TOP</em> curriculum.
