				<h1>Recipe: Smashed Burgers</h1>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Burgers are sandwich consisting of one or more patties of ground meat, placed
				inside a sliced bread roll or bun. What differentiates a smashed-burger and a burger,
				however, is that the patties are smashed during the process of cooking. These burgers 
				are quick, simple and best of all, tasty! </p>
