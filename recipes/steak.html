				<h1>Recipe: Pan-seared Steak</h1>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>As my personal favourite, steak is a phenomenal dish for special occasions. Luckily, it is a
				surprisingly simple dish. Steaks are meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially 
				including a bone. It is normally grilled, though can also be pan-fried. To sear with a frying pan, 
				make sure to use one with high thermal conductivity, such as cast-iron, stainless steel, or aluminium.
				Enjoy with potatoes, salad and your favourite drink for a satisfying dinner!
				</p>
				<h2>Ingredients</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Steak Cut of your choice (Sirloin, Scotch Fillet, Ribeye, Porterhouse etc)</li>
					<li>butter</li>

					<li>Pepper</li>
					<li>Canola Oil (high smoke point oil)</li>
					<li>Garlic cloves (with skin)</li>

				</ul>
				<h2>Steps</h2>
				<ol>

					<li>Heat a frying pan on high heat, making sure it reaches temperature</li>
					<li>Oil your frying pan</li>

					<li>After one minute, flip the steak, repeating the searing process for the other side</li>
					<li>Continue flipping in intervals until just below desired doneness</li>
					<li>Immediately reduce heat to low, or remove pan from the heat</li>
